# Restaurant Data Analysis – SQL

## Overview
This project is an end-to-end SQL data analysis of a restaurant ordering system.
The goal is to explore customer ordering behavior, item popularity, and revenue patterns
using structured SQL queries and business-driven objectives.

The analysis is divided into **three objectives**, each focusing on a different analytical angle,
from basic order exploration to revenue-driven insights.
